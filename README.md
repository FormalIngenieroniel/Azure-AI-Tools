## 🧠 Exercise Modules (Labs)

The content is structured into practical lab modules, complementing the conceptual knowledge provided in Microsoft Learn.

The labs focus on key aspects of Computer Vision and AI integration in Azure:

| Lab ID | Focus Area | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | Image Analysis & Cognitive Services | Analyzing images to extract features, tags, and descriptions using Azure AI Vision (formerly Azure Cognitive Services). |
| **02** | Optical Character Recognition (OCR) | Implementing solutions to read and extract text from images and documents, handling both printed and handwritten content. |
| **03** | Face Services & Detection | Working with the Azure AI Face service for detection, verification, and identification tasks. |
| **04** | Image Classification | Training, deploying, and utilizing custom machine learning models for image classification (e.g., categorizing objects in images). |
| **05** | Custom Vision (Object Detection) | Developing models for **Object Detection**, where the system identifies and localizes multiple objects within a single image. |
| **06** | Content Moderation | Applying AI tools to moderate content by detecting explicit material or harmful text in images and videos. |
| **07** | Video Indexer | Utilizing the Azure AI Video Indexer service to analyze videos, extract insights (transcripts, faces, keywords), and enhance searchability. |
